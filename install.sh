#
# 1. check for xcode, if it does not exist go ahead and install it
# 2. do the same for brew
# 3. if $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa does not exist, generate ssh keys and open github so
#    they can be configured there
# 4. install java with brew cask
# 5. check for maven and tomcat, install them with brew if not present
# 6. check for mysql, install it and configure if not present
# 7. install node with brew
